1. Implement a modified version of Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol with parity check so that we can use the set of integers, instead of the set of natural numbers. 

2. Implement decryption algorithm with Cantor Pairing Function and by using the private parameters extracted from parity added shared private key integer. 

3. Further extend to Unicode, instead of limiting the algorithms to ASCII.

4. Perform differential analysis of the increase in confusion added in ciphertexts compared to the original published verison.

5. Compare performance of Koblitz encoding-decoding algorithm and Cantor Pairing Function. 

6. Extend from simple transformations to complex and hypercomplex domain if possible.
